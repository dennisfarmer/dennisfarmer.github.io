## Misty Forest

A percussion ensemble piece I worked on during my trip to Craig Lake in the U.P. of Michigan. It was partially inspired by me watching the movie "The Beach" with Leonardo DiCaprio (good movie, btw). It resembles an expedition to an island, with valuable metals guarded by bloodthirsty Aztecs.

m. 1-5: Gathering the trip members

m. A-D: Driving to/arriving at the shoreline

m. E-F The expedition members launch their rafts while being attacked by natives with spears.

m. F-G3 The expedition members travel to the island.

m. G3-H: The expedition members arrive to the shoreline of the island, only to be taken hostage by waiting Aztecs.

m. H-I: The expedition members plan a brutal escape plan from within their bamboo prison cells.

m. I-J: During a dark and stormy night, the captives escape their cells and head to an armory to steal some weapons. The guards are alerted, so the members use lethal force to escape into the jungle. All of the Aztec guards are killed, but so are most of the expedition members. (Pretty brutal, I know)

m. J-L: The surviving members follow their map to the riches within the jungle.

m. L-END: I don't know lol, maybe they find the treasure within a temple and head back home with their memories. Maybe they open the chest only for it to be a pitfall trap into spikes. Maybe they get eaten by jaguars at night while sleeping in their makeshift shelters. The ending is up to discretion because I can't come up with a definitive one.
