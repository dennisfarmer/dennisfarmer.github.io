## Dreamful Night

An arrangement of two pieces from the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky soundtrack: ["Farther Away"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6Fhj298HFs&t=20885s), and ["A Wish for Peace"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6Fhj298HFs&t=20885s), both by Arata Iiyoshi. There's some seriously good tracks in that OST that'd I'd highly recommend checking out, especially [Miracle Sea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6Fhj298HFs&t=20885s), [Icicle Forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6Fhj298HFs&t=20885s), [Crystal Cave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6Fhj298HFs&t=20885s), [Vast Ice Mountain Peak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6Fhj298HFs&t=20885s), ...

This was written as an etude for the 2023 South Lyon East High School Marching Band front ensemble

Dreamful Night has many interpretations, but my favorite is that of a particularly restful night's sleep, and the journeys that our minds embark us on as they organize themselves through deep sleep. I imagine falling asleep in the intro measures, entering a lucid dream at letter E, and after exploring the dream space for a while (with some bad dream Deadliest Catch / Wanted Dead or Alive - Bon Jovi at letter F of course), opening their eyes on the last note.
