## Academia

Academia is a front ensemble etude that I wrote for my students at South Lyon East High School. The piece captures the feeling of being surrounded by limitless knowledge. Fun Fact: I wrote this all in one day, the Sunday before band camp, because I didn't want to not have something to use as a teaching tool.

Some people think parts of this piece make them think of a dreamy fairy zipping through a forest, or some other version of a magical journey. I was going for more along the lines of the University of Michigan Law Library or Harry Potter vibes, but either way this piece has a bit of magic in it.
