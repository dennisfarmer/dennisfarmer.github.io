## Real vs. Fake Faces Classification

I was a member of the Michigan Data Science Team's "Real vs. Fake Faces" project in the Fall 2023 semester, on one of the custom model architecture subteams in collaboration with four other members. We designed a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to correctly distinguish between real human faces, and faces which had been photoshopped to appear AI-generated.
