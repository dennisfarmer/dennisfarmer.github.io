## Music Recommender

[https://northstarsound.streamlit.app/](https://northstarsound.streamlit.app/)

I am building a music recommender from scratch, utilizing Principal Component Analysis to cluster and recommend tracks based on a user-submitted top-10 mixtape. All audio features used are computed from audio files scraped from YouTube, based on a scraped dataset of Spotify user playlists.

April 21st: working on making app much more user-friendly by removing the technical stuff/details from the main interface and instead putting them in a post on my website or something similar (thanks Aunt Sharon üòÅ)
